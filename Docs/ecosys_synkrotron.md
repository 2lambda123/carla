Synkrotron provides advanced solutions for autonomous driving simulation, built on top of CARLA's existing toolset to streamline scenario authoring, simulation data pipelining, sensor modelling and cloud based compute scaling tools for streamlining the AD research and development process.

## [__OASIS simulation platform__](https://www.synkrotron.ai/sim.html)

The OASIS simulation platform provides a set of tools to augment CARLA's functionality with a graphical scenario authoring tool, a built in scenario library, a scenario description language, a REST API for integration with DevOps and CI/CD piptines along with cloud computing tools for scaling AD simulation with massive concurrency. 

## [__OASIS data platform__](https://www.synkrotron.ai/data.html)

The OASIS data platform provides a data management system for managing the high volume of data required throughout the autonomous driving R&D pipeline. The OASIS data management solution helps managing data pipelines to streamline the transferral of data through data acquisition, storage, filtering, annotation, scene extraction and finally into algorithm training, testing and deployment. OASIS provides a user friendly management interface to control all aspects of the data pipeline.
